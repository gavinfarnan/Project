    <h2>What is your Website About?</h2>
    <p>I run an online business that sells fitness equipment. I will be setting up a 
        website that shows example workouts and "how to" videos on how to use my products.
    </p>
    <h2>What is the objective of your website?</h2>
    <p>The Objective of this website is to educate my customers on how and why my 
        products are used. This will supply them with helpful information on how to 
        get started on their fitness journey. This site will be important to me as well. 
        This is because I will be able to generate customer leads with this website. I will be
        able to educate the customer and increase the chances that they will buy from my 
        eCommerce website.
    </p>
    <h2>Who is the target audience?</h2> 
    <p>My target audience will be existing customers and prospective customers of my eCommerce 
        website: www.flikfitness.com
    </p>
    <h2>What content do you plan to include in each page of the webstite?</h2>
    <p>I plan on having video tutorials, pictures, and text to outline the usage of 
        my products. There will be a page for each one of my product. Then I will use videos
        to describe the uses of my products. Below the video will be branded messages that 
        will come from how I want to present myself in terms of the business as a whole.
